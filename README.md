This project is focused on guiding the farmers in growing a crop based on the environmental conditions and also demand and supply of the market.
Machine Learning models like Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest etc. are used in Crop prediction with Hyper-Parameter tuning. Data analysis is done in understanding 
the overall characteristics of the data.

Currently only six crops are supported.
